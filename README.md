Configured all the wireless devices. Esmael Mamdoh Sedky Ahmed: OSPF Configuration: Setup OSPF on Routers and Switches VLAN and ACL Security: Applied Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control communication between VLANs (e.g., blocking Guest from accessing internal resources). HSRP and Internal Vlan Routing : HSRP and Internal Vlan routing on the 13 switches plus ip DHCP helper addresses. Momen Osama Mohamed: subnetting and IP address: Configured optimized subnetting and IP addressing scheme to ensure efficient allocation of IP resources and reduce wastage. Set up network segmentation with customized subnets, enhancing both traffic management and security across various departments. Advanced Campus Network Design: Configured subnetting and IP addressing scheme for WLAN, LAN, Management, and DMZ networks across HQ and branch locations.Set up default gateways and broadcast addresses to optimize network traffic flow and ensure efficient routing.

Hamza Mohamed Sanad: High Availability & Redundancy: Configured Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) for redundancy on core switches. Set up EtherChannel and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for high availability and load balancing between switches. Final Testing and Documentation: Prepared the final presentation and compiled network diagrams, security testing results, and lessons learned.
